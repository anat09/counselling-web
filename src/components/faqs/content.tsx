  and non-judgemental relationship with you as a client. I hold an MSc (Master of Science) in Counselling and Psychotherapy 
  and BSc (Bachelor of Science) in Psychology.`, 
 ` My training background includes training in Person-Centred Therapy, complemented by techniques from 
  other therapeutic modalities such as Solution Focused Therapy (SFT), 
  Compassionate Focused Therapy (CFT), and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). This knowledge allows me to offer 
  counselling and psychotherapy that is both integrative and adaptive to your individual needs.`,

  Depending on what is going on for you, we will identify together areas you wish to work on, 
  which will be reviewed throughout our work together. That being said, the counselling sessions 
  are guided by what brings you to therapy and we will work together to explore what is going on for you, at your pace.`,

  not be the case, I will do my best to refer you to another therapist who may be better suited to your needs.`

  `Counselling sessions usually last 50 minutes each and usually take place weekly. 
  There is no obligation for you to continue our work if you feel I am not the
  right counsellor for you, or if you feel that you wish to take a break from therapy.`,
  `The number of sessions you will have depends on what you wish to explore. Some
  people find that a few sessions can provide them with enough insight to return to their
  daily life activities, with a different mindset. Others find it more benecifial to extend 
  their support and delve deeper into their life experiences. That being said, I believe your 
  wellbeing and recovery doesn't have a set number of sessions. It is unique to you.`

  explain my concerns, and try to discuss breaching confidentiality with you prior to this occurring.`
