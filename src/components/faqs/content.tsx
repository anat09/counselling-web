  `Counselling and psychotherapy are types of talking therapy* in which you can explore
  your feelings, emotions, and thoughts in a non-judgemental, safe, and confidential
  environment. Counselling can offer you that space for a shorter period of time, whilst
  psychotherapy will most definitely take place over a longer period of time. The latter
  tends to focus on deep rooted difficulties and the impact of past experiences on who
  we are, which takes time to uncover and explore.`,
  `Healing, change, recovery - these are all things that you can achieve through talking
  therapies. Whilst your therapist may not be able to give you direct advice, they can
  support you in finding out what feels right for you, in a safe manner, at your pace. In
  counselling and psychotherapy, we can begin to observe ourselves through someone
  else's lens - a lens much clearer than ours. This can bring reassurance, and a huge sense
  of hope.`,
  `My aim is to work collaboratively with you, to identify what is a stressor for you and
  how we can enrich your wellbeing, given your unique life circumstances. My training
  allows me to provide both counselling and/or psychotherapy.`,

  therapy is based on the belief that everyone is capable of growth if they are in the
  right environment.`,
  `I use an integrative approach in my work with clients, which means that I can also
  bring techniques from modalities I have trained in, to tailor our work for your unique
  experiences. On the way we may also incorporate techniques and exercises that focus on
  your strengths, self-care, values, and self-compassion.`,

  `During our first session we will use the space to find out what brings you to therapy (either as an individual or as a couple).
  Depending on what is going on for you, we may identify together
  areas you wish to work on, which will be reviewed throughout our work together.
  Above all, I want you to be in control of your growth.`,
  `There are times we need to talk things through and sometimes a therapeutic space
  can be just what we need to overcome the difficulties we face, to feel heard, validated & share
  how we feel with someone who is able and willing to sit with us in that vulnerable space.`,
  `I work from a genuine and caring place, and often bring elements of
  psychoeducation. This process aims to help your understanding of all those bits of
  you that make you who you are and understand your relationship(s). In my practice so far, this has been a key element to
  help my clients to make sense of their feelings and experiences. This allowed them
  to create a calmer and more enjoyable experience for themselves.`,
  `That being said, the counselling sessions are guided by what brings you to therapy
  and we will work together to explore what is happening for you at your pace.`

  `Counselling sessions usually last 50 minutes each and may take place weekly or
  fortnightly. There is no obligation for you to continue our work if you feel I am not the
  right counsellor for you, or if you feel that you wish to take a break from self-
  exploration.`,
  `The number of sessions you will have depends on what you wish to explore. Some
  people find that a few sessions can provide them with enough insight to return to their
  daily life activities, with a different mindset. Others find it more difficult and need a bit
  more time to begin to trust their counsellor.`,
  `We often find it difficult to trust others, once we've experienced a loss (of a loved one,
  of our old selves, of something very dear to us). We also may find it difficult to let
  others in, once we experienced a traumatic event - this could seem insignificant to
  others, and yet it has tremendous implications on our wellbeing. We all experience
  sadness, loss, trauma, happiness, joy - everything - in our own way.`,
  `As your counsellor, I endeavour to be there for you, to provide a safe space where you
  can begin to build that trust and discover yourself. Whichever option resonates with
  you, feel free to contact me, to discuss your circumstances.`

  `Sometimes, finding the right counsellor for you, a person who will "just get it", may
  take some time. Talking to a stranger may also feel intimidating at
  first. I want you to rest assured this is something I am very much aware of, having
  supported hundreds of clients in single sessions of therapy.`,
  `My aim is for you to feel comfortable to ask any questions about the process of
  therapy and express how you feel about your sessions or your progress. In my work
  so far, I noticed that once clients found a counsellor whom they feel comfortable to
  share their story with, this allowed them to feel safe in exploring their feelings.`,
  `You might feel that you're not even sure where to begin. Perhaps you are longing for
  a change and don't know how to go about it. My aim is to find all these answers with
  you - to enable you to look back to where you began this journey and think "I've
  come so far!".`
