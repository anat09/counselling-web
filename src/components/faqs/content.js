  `Counselling and psychotherapy are types of talking therapy* in which you can explore
  your feelings, emotions, and thoughts in a non-judgemental, safe, and confidential
  environment. Counselling can offer you that space for a shorter period of time, whilst
  psychotherapy will most definitely take place over a longer period of time. The latter
  tends to focus on deep rooted difficulties and the impact of past experiences on who
  we are, which takes time to uncover and explore.`,
  `Healing, change, recovery - these are all things that you can achieve through talking
  therapies. Whilst your therapist may not be able to give you direct advice, they can
  support you in finding out what feels right for you, in a safe manner, at your pace. In
  counselling and psychotherapy, we can begin to observe ourselves through someone
  else's lens - a lens much clearer than ours. This can bring reassurance, and a huge sense
  of hope.`,
  `My aim is to work collaboratively with you, to identify what is a stressor for you and
  how we can enrich your wellbeing, given your unique life circumstances. My training
  allows me to provide both counselling and/or psychotherapy.`,

    *You may notice that 'therapy &#38; therapist', 'counselling 	&#38; counsellor', and 'psychotherapy 	&#38;
    psychotherapistâ€™ are used interchangeably by mental health professionals. This is because
    Counselling is a form of Therapy and Psychology is the science behind human cognitive behaviour. For further information on counselling in general, see &nbsp;

      'An integrative counsellor aims to build a trusting and non-judgmental relationship that
      helps you develop self-awareness. When you understand the causes of your concerns or
      triggers for your behaviour, you can confidently set goals and develop new behaviours to
      improve your satisfaction with life.'

  `I appreciate it can be quite confusing to hear about different types of therapy, so feel
  free to take your time to read this summary below as an example of integrative
  therapeutic approach. Briefly explained, I use an integrative approach in my work with
  clients, which means that I bring techniques from modalities I have trained in, to tailor
  our work for your unique experiences.`,
  `My foundation of training in 'Person-Centred therapy' allows me to work from a
  caring and non-judgemental place. This form of therapy is based on the belief that
  everyone is capable of growth if they are in the right environment. On the way we may
  also incorporate techniques and exercises from:`,
  <>&#8226;&#160; Solution Focused Therapy (SFT), which can bring a focus on your strengths to identify
  how you can achieve goals that we set out together.</>,
  <>&#8226;&#160; Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), which aims to help you identify, challenge, and
  understand any interactions between your thinking &amp; behaviour patterns that may
  influence your wellbeing.</>,

  `During our first session we will use the space to find out what brings you to therapy
  and explore our contract of confidentiality, so that you have an informed decision
  when attending our sessions. The first couple of counselling sessions may also involve
  finding out what works for you, we may explore what has or has not worked so far.`,
  `Depending on your psychological and emotional needs we may create a 'plan of
  action', in which we identify together areas you wish to work on. This can always be
  adjusted and will be reviewed throughout our work together. Above all, I want you to
  be in control of your growth.`,
  `Alternatively, there are times when clients benefit from less structure and wish to
  explore life as it happens for them. Sometimes a listening ear can be just what we need
  to overcome the difficulties we face, to feel heard, validated & share our burden with
  someone who is objective to our situation.`,
  `I work from a genuine and caring place, and often bring elements of psychoeducation.
  This process aims to help your understanding of all those bits of you that make you
  who you are. In my practice so far, this has been a key element to help my clients to
  understand their feelings, accept or even challenge their thoughts. This allowed them
  to create a calmer and more enjoyable experience for themselves.`,
  `That being said, the counselling sessions are guided by what brings you to therapy and
  we will work together to find out what the best approach to this is for you, at your pace
  and depending on the things you are struggling with right now.`

  `Counselling sessions usually last 50 minutes each and may take place weekly or
  fortnightly. There is no obligation for you to continue our work if you feel I am not the
  right counsellor for you, or if you feel that you wish to take a break from self-
  exploration.`,
  `The number of sessions you will have depends on what you wish to explore. Some
  people find that a few sessions can provide them with enough insight to return to their
  daily life activities, with a different mindset. Others find it more difficult and need a bit
  more time to begin to trust their counsellor.`,
  `We often find it difficult to trust others, once we've experienced a loss (of a loved one,
  of our old selves, of something very dear to us). We also may find it difficult to let
  others in, once we experienced a traumatic event - this could seem insignificant to
  others, and yet it has tremendous implications on our wellbeing. We all experience
  sadness, loss, trauma, happiness, joy - everything - in our own way.`,
  `As your counsellor, I endeavour to be there for you, to provide a safe space where you
  can begin to build that trust and discover yourself. Whichever option resonates with
  you, feel free to contact me, to discuss your circumstances.`

  `The type of support suitable for you depends on what brings you to counselling. You
  may wish to choose to focus on a particular issue or concern you really wish to work
  on. You may wish to tailor therapy sessions with your counsellor, based on your needs.
  However, sometimes we could feel completely lost. You might feel that you're not even
  sure where to begin. Perhaps you are longing for a change and don't know how to go
  about it. My aim is to find all these answers with you - to enable you to look back to
  where you began this journey and think 'I've come so far!'.`,
  `Sometimes, finding the right counsellor for you, a person who will 'just get it', may take
  some time. Talking to a stranger may also feel intimidating (or even terrifying) at first. I
  want you to rest assured this is something I am very much aware of, having supported
  hundreds of clients in single sessions of therapy (also known as one-off counselling
  sessions).`,
  `My aim is for you to feel comfortable to ask any questions about the process of therapy
  and express how you feel about your sessions or your progress. In my experience, I
  noticed that once clients found a counsellor whom they feel comfortable to share their
  story with, this allowed them to feel safe in exploring their options, strengths,
  weaknesses.`

  only instance in which this confidentiality will be breached is if:`,

  Safeguarding Policies;`,
  `- Something mentioned in the sessions breaches The Terrorism Act (2006) or Drug
  Trafficking Act (1994)`,

  with you prior to this occurring.`,
  `I also keep regular notes of our sessions, to keep track of our work together. However,
  these will not have your contact details, or any identifiable information attached to
  them. They are also securely kept in accordance with GDPR (General Data Protection
  Regulation) Act (2018). Counsellors sometimes use their notes for purposes of case
  work evaluation with their supervisor. This is to ensure your work with them is safe
  and regulated. Again, these notes will not contain any identifiable information.`
