  `I have been working in mental health settings for over 7 years, with people from
  various backgrounds and ages, across the UK. I began supporting students & young
  people with their mental health, disability & neurodiversity in 2015 (across various
  universities in North- West - Greater Manchester & Lancaster).`,
  `Since 2018 I have also been working with survivors of childhood sexual abuse and/or
  domestic violence, in various settings and charities across the UK (SafeNet –
  Lancashire, Concrete & Savana – Staffordshire, NAPAC – Nationally). This required me
  to undertake trauma-informed training and allowed me to become a trauma informed
  therapist.`,
  `In my current work outside private practice I offer single sessions of therapy also
  known as 'one off counselling sessions', to explore what is occurring for clients in the
  here and now, identify coping strategies they can implement going forward. I also
  conduct comprehensive mental health and risk assessments with clients, to establish
  the best therapeutic approach suitable for them going forward, given their emotional,
  psychological needs.`,
  `My work experience allows me to facilitate conversations with you as a client, where
  we can identify together what works for you and if this is the right therapeutic space
  for you. Across all my experience I worked collaboratively with people, and supported
  them in building their confidence, learning about themselves. Diversity and inclusion
  also played a big role in my work so far, which allows me to confidently explore any
  impact of multiculturalism, neurodiversity, and differences on your wellbeing.`
