  "Hi there,",
  `I am Anamaria, a counsellor & psychotherapist, offering long and short-term mental health
  support services from the area of Greater Manchester and Cheshire.`,
  `You may be taking those small, yet overwhelming steps in looking after yourself and putting your
  wellbeing first - something you may have been postponing for a long time. Please try not to lose sight
  of these steps you are bravely taking right now. Reaching out takes a lot of courage, and you are here
  now. So, let's appreciate that for a moment!`,
  `Depending on our sense of safety and the support around us, we may feel prepared to handle life
  challenges most of the time. But for those times when we feel overwhelmed, confused, or completely
  burnt out, we can use a bit of support in finding our feet.`,
  `This website will hopefully give you an idea about how I work as a counsellor and whether we
  could work together. If you would like to get in touch to book a first initial consultation, or if
  you have any inquiries, please feel free to use the following contact details:`

  "Here's a little bit about how I work.",
  `I offer a therapeutic space where you can feel validated and heard, by bringing a caring and
  genuine approach to our work together. My belief is that we all experience sadness, loss,
  trauma, happiness, joy - everything - in our own way. I use an integrative
  approach in my work with clients, where I bring in different therapeutic techniques to help
  clients understand past and current life circumstances, in a safe and trusting environment.`,
  `I have extensive experience in supporting clients from multicultural and multilingual
  backgrounds, as well as clients who identify as neurodivergent. I am also a trauma-informed
  practitioner, having worked extensively with survivors of neglect, emotional, sexual, and/or
  domestic abuse within various organisations across the UK.`,
  `Our counselling sessions will be guided by what brings you to therapy, and I look forward to
  working with you. We will work together to explore any difficulties or barriers you may be
  facing. My role is to support you in finding out what your strengths are, identify what healing
  and growth may look like for you, and how you can create a fulfilling and authentic experience
  for yourself.`

  `Wherever you identify with any of the above or are just looking for a place to talk things
  through, I look forward to working with you.`,
