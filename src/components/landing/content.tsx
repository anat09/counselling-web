  <div className='text-center' > After all, going to therapy is all about connecting with another human being, who can sit with you in discomfort, 
  silence, and whatever difficulties you're struggling with. My goal is to create a therapeutic environment where you can identify and experience your feelings,  free of judgement, and find out what your needs are. When we begin to recognize our needs, we become more confident in facing life challenges. </div>,
