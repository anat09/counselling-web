  "Hi there,",
  `I am Anamaria, qualified Counsellor & Psychotherapist, with experience in supporting clients from multicultural &
  multilingual backgrounds. I support clients either in person - face to face - (Greater Manchester) or remotely (all over the UK). 
  I work with both individuals and couples, in either structured short-term or long-term open-ended therapy.`,
  `You may be here because you are taking small, yet overwhelming steps in looking after yourself, and
  putting your wellbeing first. I know from experience that reaching out is emotionally demanding, to
  say the least. If this sounds like what you are going through, I hope you can give yourself permission
  to acknowledge these steps you are bravely taking right now.`, 
 `Depending on our sense of safety and the support around us, we may feel prepared to handle life
  challenges most of the time. But for those times when we feel overwhelmed, confused,
  or experience burnout, we can use a bit of support in finding our way back to ourselves.`,
  `This website will hopefully give you an idea about how I work as a counsellor and whether we could
  work together. If you would like to get in touch to book a first session, or if you have any
  questions, please feel free to use the following contact details:`

  "Here's a little bit about how I work.",
  `My approach to therapy is rooted in the belief that each person has the capacity to heal and grow, given the right environment. 
  I believe certain “ingredients” are needed, such as curiosity, openness, and understanding, in order for people to be able to create a fulfilling 
  and authentic experience for themselves. I strive to offer a therapeutic space where clients can experience these, 
  can feel validated and heard, by bringing a caring presence to our work together.`,
  `I have experience in supporting people from multicultural backgrounds, neurodivergent clients, people impacted by cancer and/or chronic illness,
   and work related difficulties. I am also a trauma-informed practitioner, having worked extensively with survivors of neglect, emotional, sexual, 
   and/or domestic abuse, within various organisations across the UK.`,
  `Our counselling sessions will be guided by what brings you to therapy, and I look forward to working
  with you. We will work together to explore any difficulties or barriers you may be facing (either as an individual or as a couple). My role is
  to support you in finding out healing and growth may look like for you, and how you can create a
  fulfilling and authentic experience.`,
