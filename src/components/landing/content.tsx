  <p style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>About Me and How I can help</p>,
  `I have been working with people from various backgrounds and ages for nearly a decade now and I absolutely love what I do. 
  Witnessing the growth and progress of my clients is the most rewarding and humbling part of my work. 
  Having worked extensively with various mental health organisations across the UK, I supported people with a wide range of 
  challenges such as anxiety, depression, lack of self-confidence, loss, to name a few. The main focus of my work has been and always will be to provide a therapeutic environment where every individual feels valued, heard, and safe 
  — embracing all backgrounds and identities without exception.`,
  <p style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>Creating a Safe Space for Everyone is my Priority.</p>,
  `My aim in our work is to create a welcoming and supportive therapeutic space that respects and acknowledges your 
  unique experiences and identity. Whether you're experiencing challenges related to disability, gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation,
   you'll find a safe space here to explore your thoughts and feelings.`,
   <p style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>Personalized Counselling Tailored to Your Needs:</p>,
  `As a Therapist working in Private I am able to work with you as an individual and adapt to your needs. 
  Our counselling sessions will be guided by what brings you to therapy, and I look forward to working
  with you. We will work together to explore and unpack any challenges or barriers you may be facing. Together, 
  we'll explore what healing and personal growth look like for you, empowering you to build a life that 
  feels fulfilling, balanced, and true to who you are.`,
