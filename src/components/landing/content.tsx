  "Hi there,",
  `I am Anamaria, qualified Counsellor & Psychotherapist and I support clients remotely (all over the UK).`,
 
  `You may be here because you are taking small, yet overwhelming steps in looking after yourself, and
  putting your wellbeing first. I know from experience that reaching out is emotionally demanding, to
  say the least. If this sounds like what you are going through, I hope you can give yourself permission
  to acknowledge these steps you are bravely taking right now.`, 
  `When we feel overwhelmed, confused, or experience burnout, we can use a bit of support in finding our way back to ourselves.`,
  `This website will hopefully give you an idea about how I work as a counsellor and whether we could
  work together. If you would like to get in touch to book a first session, or if you have any
  questions, please feel free to use the following contact details:`

  `In nearly a decade of working extensively with various mental health organisations across the UK, I 
  have worked with a wide range of issues such as anxiety, depression, trauma, loss, to name a few. `,
  `I strive to offer a therapeutic space where clients can feel heard, understood, supported, welcome and safe, irregardless 
  of disability, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation.`,
  `Our counselling sessions will be guided by what brings you to therapy, and I look forward to working
  with you. We will work together to explore any difficulties or barriers you may be facing (either as an individual or as a couple). My role is
  to support you in finding out healing and growth may look like for you, and how you can create a
  fulfilling and authentic experience.`,
